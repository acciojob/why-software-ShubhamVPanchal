	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>
		I want to become a software developer because I enjoy using technology to solve real-life problems. I like figuring out how things work and finding ways to build useful solutions with code. The tech world is always changing, and that excites me because thereâ€™s always something new to learn. I feel happy when I see my work turn into something real on the screen. My goal is to use my skills to help others, work on important projects, and keep getting better as a developer.
